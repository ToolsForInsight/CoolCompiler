# Overview

This repo contains, among other files, a work-in-progress compiler for the COOL programming language.

I am building this compiler as part of the Stanford University's [online compilers class](http://online.stanford.edu/course/compilers-0).

The compiler will be built in parts: 1) a lexer, 2) a parser, 3) a semantic analyzer, 4) a code generator.  I will probably add 5) an optimizer as an extension.
